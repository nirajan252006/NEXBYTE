**Audit Date**: 2026-07-31  
**Target Environment**: Production Ready (Vercel + Supabase Storage / PostgreSQL)  
**Audit Author**: Antigravity AI Senior Systems Engineer

## 1. System Architecture

The NexByte Product Multi-Image System provides a production-hardened pipeline for product media management across the Admin Portal (`/admin/products`) and Customer Portal (`/products`).

```
[ Admin Portal Modal ]
       │
       ▼ (Drag & Drop / Browse - 1 to 10 Images Max, 5MB Limit)
[ Client Validation ] ──► (MIME, Extension, Max 10 Files, Blob Preview)
       │
       ▼ (POST /api/upload - Multipart FormData)
[ Server Upload API ] ──► (Magic Bytes Check, Dimension Check, Collision-Safe Path)
       │
       ├── (Production Mode: NODE_ENV === 'production') ──► [ Supabase Storage bucket: nexbyte-assets ]
       └── (Development Mode: NODE_ENV !== 'production') ──► [ Public Uploads / Local Storage ]
       │
       ▼ (HTTP 200 OK - Returns CDN Public URL & Storage Path)
[ dbHelper.products.create / update ]
       │
       ├── (Database Source of Truth - ProductImage records with is_primary & sequential sort_order)
       └── (Realtime Notification Broadcast: "products.updated")
       │
       ▼
[ Customer Portal /products ]
       ├── Card View: Loads PRIMARY Thumbnail Only (Zero Excess Bandwidth)
       └── Quick View / Gallery: Renders Large Main Image + Thumbnail Strip + Next/Prev + Lightbox Zoom
```

---

## 2. Upload Workflow

1. **Client Selection**: Admin selects 1–10 images via Drag & Drop or File Picker.
2. **Immediate Preview**: Client creates temporary `blob:` URLs for UI responsiveness.
3. **Primary Assignment**: First uploaded image is assigned `PRIMARY` (badge displayed). Admin can click "Set as Primary" on any thumbnail to switch.
4. **Ordering & Alt Text**: Admin can reorder thumbnails using Move Left / Move Right controls (updating `sort_order` 1..N) and enter custom accessibility alt text.
5. **Server Upload**: On form submit, newly selected files are posted to `POST /api/upload` as `multipart/form-data`.
6. **Object URL Cleanup**: Client invokes `URL.revokeObjectURL()` on temporary preview blobs to prevent browser memory leaks.

---

## 3. Database Schema

The product schema is persisted with normalized `ProductImage` arrays:

```typescript
export type ProductImage = {
  id: string;             // Unique image identifier
  product_id?: string;    // Associated product ID
  storage_path: string;   // Storage path (e.g. products/{productId}/{uniqueFilename})
  url: string;            // Public CDN or served URL
  is_primary: boolean;    // Exactly ONE image per product is_primary === true
  sort_order: number;     // 1-indexed sequential integer (1, 2, 3, 4...)
  alt_text?: string;      // Accessibility description
  created_at: string;     // ISO timestamp
  updated_at: string;     // ISO timestamp
};
```

---

## 4. Supabase Storage Architecture

- **Bucket Name**: `nexbyte-assets`
- **Object Path Convention**: `products/{productId}/{timestamp}_{random}_{basename}.{ext}`
- **Collision Protection**: Timestamp + 5-character random string guarantees collision safety.
- **Cache-Control Header**: `public, max-age=31536000, immutable` (for versioned unique URLs).
- **Environment Requirement**: If `NODE_ENV === "production"` and Supabase Storage credentials are missing, `/api/upload` returns `HTTP 503 Service Unavailable` (`SUPABASE_STORAGE_REQUIRED`), refusing to silently store files on serverless local filesystems.

---

## 5. Authorization Controls

- **Upload & Delete API**: Server-side checking on `POST /api/upload` and `DELETE /api/upload`.
- **Admin Privilege Verification**: Non-admin or unauthenticated requests in production return `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` / `HTTP 403 Forbidden`.
- **Database Write Operations**: Handled via secure backend dbHelper & Supabase service key. Anonymous frontend clients are restricted to READ-ONLY on public catalog queries.

---

## 6. Image Security & Validation

1. **File Size Limit**: Hard enforced at **5 MB per file**. Files exceeding 5MB are rejected with `HTTP 400 Bad Request`.
2. **File Signature / Magic Bytes Audit**:
   - `JPEG`: Begins with `0xFF 0xD8 0xFF`
   - `PNG`: Begins with `0x89 0x50 0x4E 0x47 0x0D 0x0A 0x1A 0x0A`
   - `WEBP`: Begins with `RIFF` and contains `WEBP` at bytes 8–11.
   - **Renamed Executables & Fake Images**: Replaced HTML/script files renamed as `.jpg` are caught by magic byte signature checks and rejected (`INVALID_FILE_SIGNATURE`).
3. **Decompression Bomb Protection**: Images exceeding 8000×8000 pixels are rejected prior to processing.

---

## 7. Failure Handling & Partial Upload Recovery

- **Upload Error Isolation**: If image #4 in a batch of 10 fails to upload, successful uploads (#1–#3) remain intact in draft state. An error banner is displayed with a `Retry` action.
- **Product Save Transaction Safety**: If product record creation fails, temporary upload objects are cleaned up via `DELETE /api/upload?filePath=...`.

---

## 8. Storage Object Cleanup Strategy

1. **Product Permanent Deletion**: When an admin permanently deletes a product via `dbHelper.products.permanentDelete(id)`, all associated storage objects in `p.images` are automatically deleted from storage via `DELETE /api/upload`.
2. **Image Removal During Edit**: When an admin removes 3 images from an existing product with 10 images and saves, `dbHelper.products.update` identifies the removed image URLs and dispatches `DELETE` requests to purge the orphaned storage objects.
3. **Primary Image Fallback**: Removing the primary image automatically transfers `PRIMARY` status to the first remaining image.

---

## 9. Realtime Synchronization

- **Payload Efficiency**: Realtime events emit compact metadata updates (`{ type: "products", action: "update", id: "..." }`) rather than transmitting heavy image binary data over WebSockets/SSE.
- **Auto-Sync**: Open client pages (`/products`, `/admin/products`) listen to `nexbyte-realtime` events and revalidate data without requiring manual browser refreshes.

---

## 10. Customer Gallery Architecture

- **Catalog Cards (`/products`)**: Render **PRIMARY cover image only** (`prod.image`), conserving network bandwidth.
- **Quick View Modal**: Displays Large Main Image + Scrollable Thumbnail Strip + Next/Prev Arrow Controls + Image Counter (`3 / 8`).
- **Fullscreen Zoom Lightbox**: Clicking the main image opens a high-resolution lightbox viewer (`fixed inset-0 z-[100]`) supporting keyboard ESC and close controls.

---

## 11. Performance Results

- **Memory Leak Audit**: All preview blob URLs created via `URL.createObjectURL()` are revoked via `URL.revokeObjectURL()` on removal or modal exit.
- **CDN Caching**: Unique versioned storage paths deliver immutable `31536000` second caching headers.

| **T-08** | **Set Primary Image** | **PASS** | Primary badge shifts dynamically; `product.image` cover URL updates upon save. |
| **T-09** | **Reorder Images** | **PASS** | Move Left/Right buttons swap sort order cleanly (`sort_order: 1..N`). |
| **T-10** | **Delete Primary Image** | **PASS** | Removing primary image automatically assigns `PRIMARY` status to next remaining image. |
| **T-11** | **Production Storage Requirement** | **PASS** | `/api/upload` detects `NODE_ENV === "production"` and enforces Supabase Storage configuration. |
| **T-12** | **Edit Existing Product** | **PASS** | Pre-fills existing images array into preview grid; handles updates up to 10 max. |
| **T-13** | **Permanent Delete Storage Cleanup** | **PASS** | `dbHelper.products.permanentDelete(id)` deletes product record AND dispatches storage object deletions. |
| **T-14** | **Customer Catalog Cover Image** | **PASS** | Catalog cards load PRIMARY image only (`prod.image`). |
| **T-15** | **Customer Gallery & Zoom Lightbox** | **PASS** | Quick View renders main image, thumbnail strip, next/prev buttons, counter (`3 / 8`), and fullscreen lightbox zoom. |
| **T-16** | **Production Next.js Build** | **PASS** | `npm run build` completed with **0 TypeScript errors** and **0 build errors** across 66 routes. |
| **T-17** | **Supabase Live Bucket Integration** | **BLOCKED** | Live Supabase remote environment credentials not supplied in local test environment; fallback logic verified in dev mode and production requirement enforced via code path audit. |
